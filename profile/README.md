I’m a senior software engineer and solutions architect leading **Atelier Busco**, a boutique studio acting as a **strategic technical partner** for founders and innovation leaders.

I architect and build scalable SaaS products from end-to-end. My methodology focuses on launching a robust **"Scalable MVP"** in ~90 days, built on a clean architecture (NestJS, Flutter, AWS) designed to maximize your product's **Lifetime Value (LTV)**.

## 🚀 How I Help (My Methodology)

-   **1. Discovery Workshop (Strategy):** A 2-week sprint to de-risk your project. We define the business problem, user flow, and technical architecture *before* writing the first line of code.
-   **2. Scalable MVP (SaaS in 90 Days):** I build your product's v1.0. This is not a throwaway prototype; it's your business's foundation, ready to scale.
-   **3. AI Ecosystem (Orchestration):** I don't just integrate AI, I orchestrate it. I implement our `Prompt Engine API` and `Memory Service` to build AI that learns, is secure, and is governable.
-   **4. Software Architecture (Full-Stack):** End-to-end development, from microservice APIs (NestJS) and cloud infrastructure (AWS) to mobile apps (Flutter) and web dashboards (Angular).

## 🧰 Core Tech Stack

| Domain | Key Technologies |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Backend (APIs)** | **NestJS**, Node.js, TypeScript, .NET (Core) |
| **Frontend & Mobile**| **Flutter**, **Angular**, Tailwind CSS, React |
| **AI & Automation**| **Prompt Engine API** (Proprietary), **Memory Service** (Proprietary), OpenAI, LangChain |
| **Infrastructure & Cloud** | **AWS** (Lambda, SQS, SES, DynamoDB, RDS), Serverless Framework, Docker |
| **Databases** | MySQL / MariaDB (RDS), SQL Server, DynamoDB, Redis |

## 🧱 Selected Work

-   **Media Observatory (AI + Media):** An AI platform that quantifies media probity and bias for PR agencies and Corporate Affairs.
-   **GES Tracker (HealthTech):** A health guarantee tracking platform (Chile) that empowers patients.
-   **B2B AI Assistant (AI + Ops):** A WhatsApp-based assistant that answers operational queries (e.g., account status) by integrating directly with a client's ERP.
-   **Alma App (HealthTech):** An AI conversational companion (Flutter) for perinatal mental health, co-designed with psychologists.
-   **Legislative Tracker (CivicTech):** A data intelligence platform that automates the monitoring of legislative bills.
-   **AI Ecosystem (Core Infra):** Our proprietary `Prompt Engine API` and `Memory Service` that power all our AI applications.
-   **Strategic Survey Platform (SaaS B2B):** A custom SaaS for collecting and analyzing reputational risk data.
-   **Reclamos++ (Case Management):** A case management system to centralize citizen and customer feedback.

> Many implementations are private. Technical deep-dives are available upon request.

## 🧭 Working Principles (My Methodology)

-   **Strategy Before Code:** We de-risk your investment with a `Discovery Workshop` first.
-   **Build for LTV:** We deliver your "Scalable MVP" (v1.0), not a throwaway prototype.
-   **Orchestrate, Don't Just Integrate:** We build AI that *learns* (Memory Service) and is *governable* (Prompt Engine).
-   **Clean Architecture = Lower Future Cost:** A clean backend (NestJS) and frontend (Flutter/Angular) reduces the cost of adding new features.
